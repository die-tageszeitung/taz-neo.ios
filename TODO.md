## 'Author Image CoreData validation crash'

- in  dev qa of taz 1.2.0 a crash occurred on iPhone 15Pro
- extracting device database, transfered to simulator, checks have shown that:
  - a related authorImage (IMAGEENTRY) should be saved with resolution, sharable, file, type == nil
  - in broken db there are 2 FILEENTRYs for the image: AutorImg.1030.1.png and AutorImg.1030.2.png
    the old and a newer one
  - the author and relation from FileEntry to ImageEntry and Author) is missing
- in debugging we have seen the author image is also accessed/created by section update/persist
- the error could be solved by loading old issues with the old author/author image before loading newer ones
- 2 bugfixes found, probably orphan ImageEntrys could not be solved, but should not be a problem
- additional info and problematic database in ticket: ##17089
